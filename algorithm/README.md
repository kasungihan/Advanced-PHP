# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Learn How to Work CPU

1 bit = 1,0 - in switch 
8 bit = 1 bytes

current support 32bit or 64bit

## Learn How to Work Computer Memory

5. stack(one by one) - variable load in here
4. heap - object load by here
3. uninitialized <-- ex: int y;
2. data <--- static, constant variable
1. text <--- code or program should be interpreter or compiler language

## Variable

memory create a slot for data type somewhere in menory location int x = 
1. primitive data type
   - store RAM in hexadecimal number(0xb73eb000)
2. complex data type (custom)
   - store in heap
3. Pointer in another variable location in memory

int = 32bit = 4 bytes
bool = 1 bit

## Data Structure

Array - 

$arr = [];
int x[5];

2 = x + 2 x size (int)
= x + 8

Stack - First in last out(FILO)
Heap - store data any time can get
     memory leaks solve by [garbage collector](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.php)
